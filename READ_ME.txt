#XLInputter App back-end:
The executable runs an application XLInputter, that takes .csv-style formatted (text/string) data from a user-inputed file (example given in input_data_example.txt),
and fills it based off of a position (row, column) given from user input (No built in "empty spaces" or "smart" framing.)

Openpyxl is the only current python library needed as a dependency. 
Run the executable, or feel free to use any of the methods in XLInputter.py
